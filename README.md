"Empowering Every Learner: Bridging Barriers, Enhancing Understanding"


## Project Vision

The initiative emerged from a dialogue on enhancing classroom inclusivity without undermining the value of live participation. It recognizes the potential of technology to serve as a co-pilot in learning, providing a bridge for students who might otherwise struggle to fully engage with lecture content.

## Goals
- My main Goal/AIM with this project is to make learning more accessible to the people who need it.... 
- I would like to implement it to classrooms and make the content available to the students on their study platform (BlackBoard, Student Sucess Portals,etc).
- refining the codebase to make it fit into according to the feedbacks. 

## Key Objectives

- **Support Diversity:** Tailor educational tools to benefit students facing language barriers and those requiring additional learning support.
- **Enhance Accessibility:** Make lecture content more accessible without replacing the richness of in-person learning.
- **Encourage Active Learning:** Offer a supplementary tool to complement, not replace, the live lecture experience.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Upload Recording
Students or educators upload audio recordings of lectures to the platform, adhering to consent and privacy guidelines.

### Step 2: Process & Convert
The platform processes the audio, converting it into user-preferred formats such as summaries, notes, or key points.

### Step 3: Access & Review
Users can access the processed content, enabling a deeper engagement with the material at their own pace.

## Features

- **Customizable Output:** Options for detailed summaries, simplified notes, or key highlights.
- **Pilot Feedback Mechanism:** An iterative development process informed by user feedback to refine and enhance the platform.
